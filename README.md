# Custom firmware for BLE thermometers on the Telink chipset.

**Warning: [Firmware LYWSD03MMC version 2.1.1_0159 is temporarily not supported!](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/issues/378#issuecomment-1756740533)**

Please post questions about using and setting up [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integrations on the appropriate resources!


_This repository contains custom firmware for several Bluetooth Thermometer & Hygrometer devices._
_The download of the appropriate firmware for your device will be presented automatically in [TelinkMiFlasher.html](https://pvvx.github.io/ATC_MiThermometer/TelinkMiFlasher.html). Downloading files from this repository is not required._
_Alternative firmware and configurator from ATC1441 (variant ATC_Thermometer.bin) can be found here: [atc1441/ATC_MiThermometer](https://github.com/atc1441/ATC_MiThermometer)._
_Custom firmware is not supported in MiHome. But it is possible to work LYWSD03MMC with 'Xiaomi Gateway 3' by first registering in MiHome on the official firmware, flashing to custom firmware with restoring the binding key from MiHome, replacing the device name with "LYWSD03MMC" and setting the advertising type to "MIJIA (MiHome)" marked "encrypted"._<br>

_Support for Zigbee firmware is in the [ZigbeeTLc](https://github.com/pvvx/ZigbeeTLc) repository._<br>

_Support for BLE-Zigbee firmware is in the [BZdevice](https://github.com/pvvx/BZdevice) repository._<br>

_There is an alternative firmware from [Ivan Belokobylskij](https://github.com/devbis) for [LYWSD03MMC to work in Zigbee 3.0 mode](https://github.com/devbis/z03mmc)._

The custom firmware can be flashed _via a modern browser_ and _over-the-air (OTA)_ without opening the device and unlocks several customization options. You can go back to the original firmware at any time. OTA and configuration main page - [TelinkMiFlasher.html](https://pvvx.github.io/ATC_MiThermometer/TelinkMiFlasher.html).

Due to unclear sanctions from English-speaking countries, this and related projects will most likely be closed to English-speaking users. Or provided on a paid basis.
Access to github is already slowing down. Most Internet information resources have long been blocking on their side.

**Warnings**

1. [Home Assistant SSD TBW](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/issues/394). Using the Home Assistant with Bluetooth leads to rapid wear of the data carrier due to constant database recording and [overwriting of small Bluez files](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/76540#issuecomment-1303106780) in ['/var/lib/bluetooth/'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65957677/bluez-change-local-storage-directory).

With a couple dozen BLE devices, a 256GB SSD is only enough for 2 years.

2. If you have many BLE devices, the adapter must be able to receive BLE advertisements every 3 ms.

UART speeds of 921600 baud and even USB1.1 are not enough to transfer information in binary form in the HCI format.

Requires BT adapter with USB2.0 HS. Otherwise, there will be many gaps in the reception. [Do not use ESP32xxx](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/discussions/328) - it cannot work with BLE at normal speed and drains the batteries of all BLE devices when connected! ESPHome does not work with Bluetooth 5.0 and misses a lot of advertising packets from BLE devices.

3. For reliable connection and refirmware on LYWSD03MMC, the battery level must be more than 40%. This is a design feature - a [cheaper version of the hardware from Xiaomi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12629515/105704705-423fc600-5f20-11eb-88ca-a2db712d0222.png).

[On devices with missing power capacities](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/issues/265#issuecomment-1431495494), do not set 'Connect latency' to more than 1000 ms!

4. Home Assistant in "Bluetooth" integration does not full support Bluetooth  5.0 and is not implied. 

[How to switch the USB-BT5.0+ adapter to work in LE Long Range in Home Assistant under Linux:](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/issues/297)

On thermometers with a button, if the button function is set to Connect, then a short application on the button for 80 seconds enables connection in BT4.0 mode.

If you accidentally set the 'LE Long Range' on the thermometer, and your device does not support BT5.0, remove and insert the battery - the thermometer will switch to BT4.2 support mode.

If you have a smartphone with BT5.0+ and the nRFConnect program, then you can reset all settings to default by connecting to a thermometer and sending the 0x56 command, as shown in the screenshot:

![img nRFConnect_set_default.png](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/blob/master/img/nRFConnect_set_default.png)

To disable only the 'Long Range' option, use the code 0xDD.

The [Web Bluetooth API](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/blob/main/implementation-status.md) in Chrome does not yet allow scanning for Bluetooh 5.0+ devices.

5. On Linux, when installing large advertising intervals, change the file '/etc/bluetooth/main.conf', variables: `LEScanIntervalAutoConnect=` `LEScanWindowAutoConnect=`. Value in ms.

<!-- /TOC -->


## Getting Started 

You can conveniently flash, update and configure the bluetooth thermometers remotely using a bluetooth connection and a modern web browser.

### Flashing or Updating the Firmware (OTA)

To flash or update the firmware, use a Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Opera Browser.

1. Go to the [Over-the-air Webupdater Page `TelinkMiFlasher.html`](https://pvvx.github.io/ATC_MiThermometer/TelinkMiFlasher.html) *
2. If using Android, Windows, Linux: Ensure you enabled "experimental web platform features". Therefore copy the according link (i.e. `chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features` for Chrome), open a new browser tab, paste the copied URL. Now sten the _Experimental Web Platform features_ flag to _Enabled_. Then **restart the browser**.
3. For all sensors with a button, before activation, it is necessary to reset the past bindings by holding the button for a long time.
4. In the Telink Flasher Page: Press `Connect`: The browser should open a popup with visible Bluetooth devices. Choose the according target device (i.e. `LYWSD03MMC`) to pair. 
5. After connection is established a _Do Acivation_ button appears. Press this button to start the decryption key process.
6. Now you can press the _Custom Firmware ver x.x_ button to directly flash the custom firmware. Alternatively you can choose a specific firmware binary (i.e. the original firmware) via the file chooser
7. Press _Start Flashing_.

 * Use [TelinkOTA](https://pvvx.github.io/ATC_MiThermometer/TelinkOTA.html) to flash old or alternative versions ([ATC1441](https://atc1441.github.io/TelinkFlasher.html)). This is a program for OTA projects with Telink SDK, no third-party (mijia) protections.

 * Addition for CGG1-M: Press and hold the button on the back of CGG1-M for 2 seconds until the Bluetooth icon starts blinking on the e-ink display, and then click the 'Connect' and 'Do Activation' buttons on the [TelinkMiFlasherl](https://pvvx.github.io/ATC_MiThermometer/TelinkMiFlasher.html).

 * [Addition for MJWSD05MMC](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/issues/307): Press and hold both buttons for a few seconds until the screen blink (device resets). Next, briefly press the top side button, then briefly press the bottom button. The Bluetooth icon will start flashing.  Next 'Connect' and 'Do Activation' in [TelinkMiFlasher](https://pvvx.github.io/ATC_MiThermometer/TelinkMiFlasher.html).

### Configuration
After you have flashed the firmware, the device has changed it's bluetooth name to something like `ATC_F02AED`. Using the [`TelinkMiFlasher.html`](https://pvvx.github.io/ATC_MiThermometer/TelinkMiFlasher.html) you have various configuration options.

**General process:**
1. Press _Connect_
2. Select the according device to connect/pair (i.e.  `ATC_F02AED`)
3. Several configuration options appear
4. Choose _Send Config_ to send changed value to the device. Or press _Set default_ and then _Send config_ to revert to the Defaults

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| _Temperature and Humidity offset_ | Enter a value to correct the offset of the Temperature or Humidity displayed: For example `-1.4` will decrease the Temperature by 1.4°
| _Smiley or Comfort_ | Choose a static smiley or check the "Comfort" Radio box to change the smiley depending on current Temperature and Humidity. |
| _Comfort Parameters_ | Defines the Lower (Lo) and Upper (Hi) Range for Temperature and Humidity interpreted as comfort zone. In the default configuration a smiley will appear.
| _Advertising Type_ | Type of supported [Bluetooth Advertising Formats](#bluetooth-advertising-formats).
| _Set time_ | sends the current time to the device
| _Comfort, Show batt, Clock_ | Ticking the according boxes you can enable interval rotation between different LCD screens. See the example video below.

* For SHTC3 in "lowPower" the accuracy is reduced.
* For SHT4x in "lowPower" you get a delay for the polling period, but the accuracy remains.

**Example of LCD display modes**

You can configure different LCD Display modes using _Comfort, Show batt_ and _Clock_ configuration checkboxes. The enabled LCD Display Modes will appear one-by-one in a loop. 

[![YoutubeVideo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/HzYh1vq8ikM/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HzYh1vq8ikM)

Battery and clock display are enabled in the settings. The rest of the settings is kept default. The video contains 2 cycles.

## Applications

### Reading Measurements from Flash

[GraphMemo.html](https://pvvx.github.io/ATC_MiThermometer/GraphMemo.html)

To record the measurement results, a cyclic buffer in the flash memory for 20000 measurements is used.
The recording step interval is set in the interface.
With the default settings, the recording step is 10 minutes, which gives a recording depth of 4 and a half months.
During the step period, the sensor data and battery voltage are averaged, time stamped, and written to flash memory.

Setting the value to 0 disable logging to internal storage.

### Bluetooth Advertising Formats

The Firmware can be configured to support one of four different Bluetooth advertisements data formats:

Xiaomi, ATC, Custom, BTHome and encrypted options. 

Supports bindkey beacon encryption.

[Advertising formats](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/issues/298).

[Test program](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/tree/master/python-interface) of used Bluetooth Advertising formats provided by [Ircama](https://github.com/Ircama).

Only the [BTHome](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bthome/) and Xiaomi support the native [HA Xiaomi Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/xiaomi_ble/), for the others use the Custom Component [Passive BLE](https://github.com/custom-components/ble_monitor). 

* (!) Custom Component [Passive BLE](https://github.com/custom-components/ble_monitor) does not [support Bluetooth 5.0](https://github.com/custom-components/ble_monitor/issues/1135) (LE Long Range).

### Temperature or humidity trigger (GPIO PA5 LYWSD03MMC label on the "reset" pin)

Xiaomi LYWSD03MMC has a PCB soldering test point. Available without disassembling the case and [marked "Reset"](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/tree/master/BoardPinout). 
Use as a trigger output with adjustable temperature and / or humidity hysteresis. 
Hysteresis and thresholds are set in TelinkMiFlasher.html. The output status is displayed in the advertising package.

![trg_menu](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/blob/master/img/trg_menu.gif)

![trg_grf](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/blob/master/img/trg_grf.gif)

Hysteresis: 
> * =0 off, 
> * if less than zero - activation on decrease, 
> * if more than zero - activation on excess

Setting the pin to "1" or "0" works if both hysteresis are set to zero (TRG off).

[Trigger and reed switch status receiver on JDY-10 module ($1).](https://github.com/pvvx/AdScanerTrg)

### Reed switch or button functions

For CGG1, MHO_C401, CGDK2, MJWSD05MMC, a button on the case is used.

It is possible to solder a reed switch on the LYWSD03MMC board to the pins marked "P8" (GPIO PA6) and GND.

![RS_LYWSD03MMC_1.jpg](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/blob/master/BoardPinout/RS_LYWSD03MMC_1.jpg)

The button on the body can turn the light on and off when creating a scenario in an external program...

The state of the reed switch or button is transferred to the advertising packet and events are sent in the "Switch" and "Counter" modes.

Setting the "Connect" option has several functions:

1. Short press for 80 seconds turns on the ability to connect with a device in BLE 4.2 format
2. Long press toggles temperature display to C or F.
3. Holding more than 20 seconds will reset the device settings to default. 

* [For MJWSD05MMC, the 'Connect' function is always configured on the top button](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/issues/307).

### The USB-COM adapter writes the firmware in explorer. Web version.

[USBCOMFlashTx.html](https://pvvx.github.io/ATC_MiThermometer/USBCOMFlashTx.html) - Uses a partial imitation of the `Telink 1-Wire` protocol on a USB-UART adapter, but only for transmission to the chip.

For programming and debugging, the chip uses a special hardware protocol `Telink 1-Wire` (not even close to UART!).

To match the frequencies of the Telink 1-Wite bus, no change in Baud-rate is required.

While the chip is sleeping and when the SWS pin is reassigned, there is no access to programming.

You can restore communication via “Telink 1-Wire” by rebooting the chip and sending a command to stop the CPU. This is called "Activation".

The [USBCOMFlashTx.html](https://pvvx.github.io/ATC_MiThermometer/USBCOMFlashTx.html) program does not have feedback - it does not receive data from the chip. This is a simplified version and only works if all connections are made correctly.

![USBCOMFlashTxHtml](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/blob/master/img/USBCOMFlashTxHtml.gif)

![webpgm.png](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/blob/master/img/webpgm.png)

In difficult cases, when the chip contains an unknown FW, it is necessary to use a chip reset or power supply during "activation". 

![atime.png](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/blob/master/img/atime.png)

At the same time, take into account that the chip can be powered from the TX output. This is solved by connecting TX and +Vbat during "activation".

2. [TlsrComProg](https://github.com/pvvx/TlsrComProg825x) - uses a bootloader with the transition to working via the UART protocol.
3. [TLSRPGM](https://github.com/pvvx/TLSRPGM) - full hardware option Telink 1-Wire up to 2 mbit/s

![TabPins](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/blob/master/BoardPinout/TabPins.gif)

For LYWSD03MMC, the HW version is determined by the display and sensor addresses on I2C:

|HW | LCD I2C   addr | SHTxxx   I2C addr | Note |
|-- | -- | -- | -- |
|B1.4 | 0x3C | 0x70   (SHTC3) |  |
|B1.5 | UART | 0x70   (SHTC3) |  |
|B1.6 | UART | 0x44   (SHT4x) |  |
|B1.7 | 0x3C | 0x44   (SHT4x) | Test   original string HW |
|B1.9 | 0x3E | 0x44   (SHT4x) |  |
|B2.0 | 0x3C | 0x44   (SHT4x) | Test   original string HW |

Version 1.7 or 2.0 is determined at first run by reading the HW line written in Flash.
Display matrices or controllers are different for all versions, except B1.7 = B2.0.
